hi

recently, i've been getting into linux! coincidentally (and *actually* coincidentally) windows 10 is reaching end-of-life\
i still have windows 10 installed, and i will use it for things like fl studio, but i just wanted to get into linux again for the hell of it! and i don't plan on upgrading windows any time soon :p

i'm posting here as i finally got flash working, as well as other basic features! (like being able to update my sites...)
this means i will be able to update more again! :D\
additionally, i will be trying to update more consistently by coming up with commands if none are submitted within like. two days. people won't gee ay eff about this mspa if i don't update it!
