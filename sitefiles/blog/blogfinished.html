<p>hi! welcome to the first REAL blogpost on this site
<br>i'm remaking PSFLA with 11ty! this is due to the previous php version being a mess to manage.
<br>this will also make it compatable with <a href=https://nekoweb.org/ target=_blank>nekoweb</a>'s hosting options... i already use nekoweb for hosting my <a href=https://thepersonever.net/ target=_blank>personal site</a>, and my supporter tier includes hosting multiple sites!</p>
<p>this site is not yet finished, however... i still have to finish the javascript portion of my mspa reader, so that it runs about as fast as mspfa's. until that point, the php version of PSFLA will still be present on the <a href=https://psfla.net target=_blank>psfla.net</a> domain, and the 11ty version will be hosted on <a href=https://psfla.nekoweb.org target=_blank>psfla.nekoweb.org</a></p>
<p><small>pst. if you're seeing this, that means you're looking at the 11ty version!</small></p>
