hi!

just finished the new navbar. it was kind of a pain to figure out how to make the background images pixelated...\
what they don't tell you in (w3)schools is that `image-rendering: pixelated;` applies to background images too!! 

i'm wondering if i should make a discord server but like. it feels a little early to be making one. so im probably gonna wait until i feel like PSFLA has an actual following\
in the meantime... sign the new [guestbook!](https://psfla.atabook.org/) i literally just made it :D 

but um... yeah! gonna start working on updates more soon. i'm really excited i feel like i actually have people looking at my MSPAs now :3
