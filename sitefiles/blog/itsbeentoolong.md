hello!

it's been. um. a little bit  
i've been swamped with schoolwork for quite a while now, and on top of that other personal projects were getting in the way of working on 13337... but now i should be able to update this site more consistently! i'm planning to work on this site when i don't feel motivated to do whatever i have to do next (be it schoolwork or project hell), so that this story can like. actually start moving lmao  
i haven't worked on anything for 13337 in so long i've started scratching at the walls clawing up my furniture killing people. i've been killing people. i swear. this is why i'm updating this site again

anyways! have fun reading the more consistent updates >_<  
and please submit a prompt while you're at it
