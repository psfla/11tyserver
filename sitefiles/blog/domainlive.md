##  *finally, people will be able to view what i have been doing for the past week!!!*

yeah. finally got the 11ty version of this site to the point where i feel like i can call it the "main version" of this site!\
you can find the php version <a href="https://php.psfla.net/" target=_blank>here</a>, but it won't be updated anymore.

like most rewrites of sites i create, this rewrite was made because the backend of php PSFLA was a mess. now, the backend is less of a mess!\
it's still a mess though. you can check out the source <a href="https://github.com/psfla/11tyserver" target=_blank>here</a>, if you're so inclined

i'm hopefully planning to update this site more, as well! fixing the quickprompt not displaying in firefox-based browsers should help with getting prompts, but i plan to write my
own prompts if nobody responds for long enough. more promo across the indieweb might also help with getting prompts, but that's just something i'll have to keep in mind :p
