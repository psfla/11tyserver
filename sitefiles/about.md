<h1>...the website!</h1>

PSFLA is a website created by me (<a href=https://thepersonever.net/ target=_blank>thepersonever</a>) to host my mspaint adventures! \
originally starting in 2024, PSFLA was first made with php. however, php sucks! so around may of 2025, i recreated it with <a href=https://www.11ty.dev/ target=_blank>11ty</a>!!

like most MSPAs, adventures on this site are largely user-driven. you prompt a character to do something, and they'll probably do it! you can submit a prompt via quickprompt, or by sending an ask to the <a href=https://www.tumblr.com/psfla target=_blank>tumblr blog</a> :D 

MSPAs excite me more than any other medium, due to having the flexibility of the *web*. change the css styling for the sake of the story! have an animation that fucks with the boarders of some divs! do the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhOEs43FN-s" target=_blank>warioland shake it thing</a> and have all of your text, images, and links fall off the page!!! you can do ANYTHING with a website you've created

the adventures on PSFLA takes heavy inspiration from andrew hussie's MSPAs, but i wouldn't call my adventures "fan adventures".  is bioshock a fangame based off of half life 2
