<h1>...the website!</h1>

PSFLA is a website created by me (<a href=https://thepersonever.net/ target=_blank>thepersonever</a>) to host my MSPAs!   
the name for PSFLA was created when i just needed... a name for a <a href=https://thepersonever.net/tests/mspa/ target=_blank>javascript-powered MSPA reader</a> that i was working on for practice in 2023. at the time, the PS and FL were taken from photoshop and flash - but now? they're legally distinct baby. can't sue me for this site  
i use krita in place of photoshop now anyways :p  
the production version of this website began development in 2024, and was coded in php! but i didn't really need php for this site... so around may of 2025, i recreated it with <a href=https://www.11ty.dev/ target=_blank>11ty</a>, so it could be hosted on the same hosting provider as TPE :D (it's cheaper this way okay)

like most MSPAs, adventures on this site are largely user-driven. you prompt a character to do something, and they'll probably do it! you can submit a prompt via quickprompt (which is present on the last page of every story), or by sending an ask to the <a href=https://www.tumblr.com/psfla target=_blank>tumblr blog</a> :)

MSPAs excite me more than any other medium, due to having the flexibility of the *web*. change the css styling for the sake of the story! have an animation that fucks with the boarders of some divs! do the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhOEs43FN-s" target=_blank>warioland shake it thing</a> and have all of your text, images, and links fall off the page!!! you can do ANYTHING with a website you've created

the adventures on PSFLA takes heavy inspiration from andrew hussie's MSPAs, but i wouldn't call my adventures "fan adventures". is bioshock a half life 2 fangame

<h1>...the author!</h1>

hi i'm jade floase - aka the webmaster of a website that's linked on this page twice ;>_> \
i love using tech to make art, and perusing around the indie web! but you <a href=https://thepersonever.net/abtme target=_blank>might already know that</a> ;P

i've been working with websites in general since about 2022, and i've been involved with MSPA production since 2023. i'm always getting better at art, so please don't mind if my adventures jump around in quality sometimes! i don't wanna redraw each sprite every two months :(
